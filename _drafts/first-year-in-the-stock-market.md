I'd been wanting to invest in the stock market for quite a while. And then, last February, this happened.

I thought this was my chance and bought my first shares then.

It's now been one year since my first investment so this is a good time to re-examine my strategy.

This is what I did.

# Strategy

To buy stock shares I used [DEGIRO], an online european broker. Its fees are low and its website and mobile app are easy enough to use. Buying and selling some european [ETF]s is even free. However I mostly opted for shares of American companies.

On February I invested a lump sum I'll call LP. From then on I used the [Dollar-Cost Averaging strategy] - investing the same amount on regular intervals, regardless of market conditions. Each month I added to my investment an amount more or less equal to LP/12. I would usually buy new shares at the start of each month. However, if I noticed a particularly good buying opportunity I'd buy shares a little sooner. I would always invest the same amount per month though.

I mostly picked tech stocks (Apple, Microsoft) and BRK.B (Berkshire Hathaway) as a proxy for an ETF.

And that was it.

That was my strategy.

# Insights

Here's some of the stuff I learned this past year:

* DEGIRO charged me a 0.50€ fee to buy (and sell) shares. Also, my bank charged me a 0.52€ fee to transfer money to DEGIRO.
  All summed up I had to pay 1.02€ in fees each month, and that's if I bought shares of a single stock. If I bought shares of two different stocks I'd have to pay 1.52€ total. Assuming the minimum of 1.02€, this meant that if I only invested 100€ per month I'd automatically lose 1.02% of my investment.

  If I invested 200€ per month my fees would add up to 0.51% of my investment.

  If I invested 400€ per month my fees would add up to 0.255% of my investment.

  You get the picture.

  This detail is important in calculating when and how much one should invest. Automatically losing 1% is quite bad if we take into account the fact that [the average annual return in the stock market is around 7%].

  If you can't increase the amount of money invested you should increase the amount of time between investments. If you only have 100€ to invest per month you should probably consider investing every two months. This way you'll lower the percentage of your investment that you lose every time you invest.

* There are lots of (contradictory) catch-phrases that make you sound smart in any situation:

  - "Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful." - Warren Buffett

    Meaning: invest in the market even if it's going down since it will go up at some point.

  - "Don't try to catch a falling knife."

    Meaning: _don't_ invest in the market if it's going down since it will fall even further.

  Be careful with what you read online.

* Some quotes do contain some knowledge:

  - "Time is your friend; impulse is your enemy." – John Bogle

  - "Time in the market beats timing the market."

  Be patient.

* And other adages you end up learning from experience:

  - "Don't invest what you're not willing to lose."

  - "Sell to the sleeping point."

  Don't invest _too much_. How much is too much? You'll found out soon enough.

* I realised that having quick and easy access to my investments through the DEGIRO app was

  1. Stressing me out
  2. Making me want to touch my investments

  I had to learn to stop checking the DEGIRO app (and Apple's Stock app) every day.

  If you lack this type of self-awareness and self-control I'd recommend uninstalling your broker's app from your smartphone and only using your broker's website. Investing through your bank is another option (though most banks now also have apps of their own).

  The more inconvenient you make it for yourself to touch your investments the less likely you are to do so.

Some of this stuff may sound pretty basic,

# Results

So what was the outcome of my investment?

You probably thought I was smart for investing in February, right?

Well, here's what happened next:

<img src="/assets/images/2018-first-half.png" alt="TODO" />

Yeah, that's right. A mere month after my initial LP investment, the market went down _again_. At that point I was losing money (but by a very small margin, like 1% total).

But then, Christmas happened:

<img src="/assets/images/2018-2019.png" alt="TODO" />

Yup.

Here's my advice to you:

As soon as you put money in the markets you realise the whole world is conspiring to bring down your investment.
Sanctions. Tariffs. Trump. Brexit. Trade wars.
The markets find any and every little excuse to screw with your money.

The thing is, there was always something going on in the world.
You just didn't notice it before because you weren't _invested_ in it.
Now that you are, you need to get used to it.

# What about now?

The original plan was to invest every single month in an S&P 500 ETF like VOO or SPY. Finding


I found out that this was due to a new European legislation called [MiFID II], introduced on 1 January 2018, requires all ETFs (and other derivatives) to provide documentation in the native language of the country where they are traded. Since these funds did not produce documentation in Portuguese, they were no longer allowed to sell in my country.




I am now 100% cash. I don't own shares of any stock.

I wasn't happy with how I felt.
Maybe it was all just a big gamble.
I am now reading the book [The Intelligent Investor] and I'. After I finish it I am going to rethink my strategy.
