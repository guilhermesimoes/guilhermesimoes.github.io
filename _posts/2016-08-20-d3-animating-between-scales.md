The purpose of this gist is two-fold:

1. Demonstrate how to animate between scales;

2. Show how data visualization depends on the chosen scale.

   For example, we can see how some data clusters using the power scale. The datums `1` and `10` are rendered on the same spot. If we had a lot of these points close to each other and performance was a concern, filtering out some of these points could prove valuable.
