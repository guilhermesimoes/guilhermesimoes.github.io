So this happened recently in a project at @work. I was analyzing the size of this project's bundle and noticed that a lot of `@company/internal-lib`'s code was being included twice. I tracked down all the imports of this library and found that on a file we were doing this:

```ts
import { x } from '@company/internal-lib';
```

But on another file we were doing this:

```ts
import { y } from '@company/internal-lib/lib/y';
```

We were importing from `/lib/y` because `internal-lib`'s main index file wasn't exporting `y`, and it was easier and quicker for a developer to import directly from that path than to submit a patch to the repository of `@company/internal-lib`, release a new version, and then change the project's `package.json` to use that new version.

This slightly different import was the apparent cause of all that duplicate code.

But why?

First of all, it was because `@company/internal-lib` is written in TypeScript, and there's a build/publish step that creates two different folders to be consumed by various projects:

```
internal-lib
├── package.json
├── src
|   ├── index.ts
|   └── ...
├── lib
|   ├── index.js
|   └── ...
└── es
    ├── index.js
    └── ...
```

The `lib` folder contained code transpiled to CommonJS and the `es` folder contained the same code transpiled to a more modern JavaScript format.<sup id="reverse-footnote-1"><a href="#footnote-1" rel="footnote">[1]</a></sup>

Then, internal-lib's `package.json` contained this:

```ts
"main": "./lib/index.js",
"module": "./es/index.js",
```

The [`main` field] is the primary entry point of the package, as per Node's original spec. This means that code like `require('@company/internal-lib')` actually imports the file `./lib/index.js`.<sup id="reverse-footnote-2"><a href="#footnote-2" rel="footnote">[2]</a></sup>

The `module` field is **_another_** entry point, this time used by most bundlers (such as [ESBuild][ESBuild module], [Rollup][Rollup module] and Webpack). For a long time, there were [multiple competing standards for JavaScript modules], such as CommonJS (CJS), AMD, and UMD. Ultimately, ECMAScript Modules (or ESM), in conjunction with the `module` field, was [the proposal that bundlers agreed on] because it lead to better code [tree-shaking].<sup id="reverse-footnote-3"><a href="#footnote-3" rel="footnote">[3]</a></sup>

Finally, our project was using Webpack which prefers ESM and looks for that `module` field. So when we did a regular `import { x } from '@company/internal-lib'` Webpack went to the `es` folder. But when we did an `import { y } from '@company/internal-lib/lib/y'` we forced Webpack to go to the `lib` folder and load [CommonJS code which isn't easily tree-shakable].

And there you have it.

That innocent-looking import was the cause of all the duplicate code. We fixed it by submitting a patch to `@company/internal-lib` to export `y` from its main index file and then updating all the imports inside the project. We also forbade the problematic imports with ESLint's [`no-restricted-imports`] rule so we don't repeat this mistake.

Watch out for this in your codebase. Don't make the same mistake!
